This repository is created to post some sample codes, exercise solutions in JAVA and some complementary materials for my CPSC 319 tutorial sections. 

All the students have the authority to download, modify, copy, etc the codes. 

Enjoy your code review!

> **Note:** Following codes have been post in **src** folder:

> - Some sample codes in the tutorial 01-03;

> - Some sample codes in the tutorial 04 and my solution to exercise2. the output of exercise2 are also offered as snapshot and .txt file. 

> - A screenshot about how to parse command line by eclipse.

> - T07 sample codes "SingleLinkedList" class and test cases. 

> - T09 sample code, implementation of compareTo ( Object o ) methods and show how to apply quick sorting algorithm to an array of objects.  It could be easily converted to an array of reference. 

> - T09 sample code ( bufferReader ) for BufferedReader, FileReader and sample.txt are uploaded.

> - T10 Stack interface and LinkedList Stack implementation is uploaded.
Array-based stack implementation is uploaded. 

> - T10 Stack based big number addition code ( T10 Exercise ): BigNumberAddition.java is uploaded.

> -  T11 Queue interface, and its LinkedList and array implementation are uploaded. 
ArrayQueue.java, LinkedQueue.java, Queue.java

> -  T12 Binary Search Tree interface ( BSTInterface.java ) and its implementation is uploaded. 

> - T12 BST traversal implementations (recursive DFT implementation and non-recursive BFT implementation are uploaded.)

> -  T13 MatrixDG implements the data structure (Unweighed, Undirected) Graph is updated.
